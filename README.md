# Hardware : Augmented Reality (AR) with Lens Studio

In this workshop you will learn how to make your first AR modelisation and filter with Lens Studio. :muscle:

You will first learn how to create objects and then how to link several objects to create a complete filter.

At the end of this workshop you will be creating simple modelisations (lens). These modelisations can be published to Snapchat.

## Setup:

The first step is to install Lens Studio, you can find the necessary documentation just below: :books:
You go to this [link](https://ar.snap.com/download) and download the latest version.

### 1. Make a filter with sound

And select "Audio"

### 3. Make a full body filter
Make a filter using corpo.obj (or any 3d body model)

### 4. Feel free to explore!
Make a filter using corpo.obj (or any 3d body model)

## :tada: Congratulation !

You now know the basics of Lens modelling. Feel free to use your imagination to implement many other shapes.
Or combine the previous exercises for new results.
